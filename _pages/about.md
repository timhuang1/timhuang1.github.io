I am now a third year Ph.D. student in [School of Computing and Information System](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/) in University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia. My supervisor is Prof. [Rui Zhang](http://www.ruizhang.info/) and Dr. [Jianzhong Qi](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/jianzhongq/). My major research interests are in natural language processing and machine learning.
